                    <p><strong>Blood sugar:</strong> Improvements can be seen within the first 1-2 weeks of starting treatment.</p>
                    <p><strong>Weight loss:</strong> Typically becomes noticeable after 4-8 weeks. Most patients see significant results by 3-6 months.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The gradual dose titration (starting low and increasing slowly) is designed to minimize gastrointestinal side effects like nausea and vomiting. Starting at the full dose would cause severe GI symptoms in most patients. The initiation doses (0.25 mg for semaglutide, 2.5 mg for tirzepatide) are not therapeutic — they're meant to help your body adjust.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes, you can change the day of the week you inject, as long as there are at least 2 days (48 hours) between doses. For example, if you normally inject on Sundays but want to switch to Fridays, you can make the change as long as it's been at least 2 days since your last injection.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">How much weight will I lose?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Results vary significantly between individuals. Based on clinical trials:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ozempic (2 mg):</strong> 12-14 lbs average (diabetes population)</li>
                        <li><strong>Wegovy (2.4 mg):</strong> 15-17% of body weight (about 35 lbs for someone starting at 200 lbs)</li>
                        <li><strong>Mounjaro (15 mg):</strong> 15-25 lbs (diabetes), up to 25% in weight loss studies</li>
                        <li><strong>Zepbound (15 mg):</strong> 20-22% of body weight</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Your results depend on: starting weight, dose achieved, diet and exercise habits, individual metabolism, and how long you take the medication.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Will I regain weight if I stop taking the medication?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Unfortunately, yes — studies show most patients regain a significant portion of lost weight within 1-2 years of stopping. The STEP 1 extension trial found participants regained about two-thirds of their weight loss one year after stopping semaglutide.</p>
                    <p>This is why GLP-1 medications are considered chronic treatments for obesity, similar to how blood pressure medications are chronic treatments for hypertension. Discuss long-term plans with your doctor.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">Why did my weight loss plateau?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Weight loss plateaus are common and can occur for several reasons:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Metabolic adaptation:</strong> As you lose weight, your body requires fewer calories</li>
                        <li><strong>Not at maximum dose yet:</strong> Higher doses produce more weight loss</li>
                        <li><strong>Dietary drift:</strong> Eating habits may have gradually increased</li>
                        <li><strong>Natural variation:</strong> Weight fluctuates daily; look at trends over weeks</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you've plateaued at a lower dose, your doctor may increase to the next dose level. If you're already at the maximum dose, focus on maintaining your current loss.</p>

                        <li>Alcohol may worsen nausea, especially early in treatment</li>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes. GLP-1 medications are approved as an "adjunct to diet and exercise" — they work best when combined with healthy lifestyle changes. The clinical trials that showed impressive results included lifestyle counseling for all participants.</p>
                    <p>That said, the medications make it easier to eat less by reducing appetite and cravings. Many patients find they can finally stick to healthy eating habits that were impossible before.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>GLP-1 medications should be stopped <strong>at least 2 months before planned pregnancy</strong> due to potential fetal risks seen in animal studies. Use effective contraception while taking these medications.</p>
                    <p>Interestingly, weight loss from GLP-1 medications may improve fertility in women with PCOS or obesity-related infertility. If you become pregnant while taking a GLP-1, stop the medication immediately and contact your doctor.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>GLP-1 medications slow gastric emptying, which can increase the risk of aspiration during anesthesia. Many anesthesiologists recommend:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hold the medication for at least 1 week before elective surgery</li>
                        <li>Some recommend 2-3 weeks for longer-acting formulations</li>
                        <li>Follow a liquid diet 24 hours before surgery</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Mounjaro (tirzepatide) has shown greater A1C reduction and weight loss than Ozempic (semaglutide) in head-to-head trials. However, "better" depends on your situation:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mounjaro advantages:</strong> More potent for blood sugar and weight loss</li>
                        <li><strong>Ozempic advantages:</strong> Longer track record, proven cardiovascular benefit (SUSTAIN 6), more widely available</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Both are excellent options. Your doctor can help determine which is best for you based on your health history and insurance coverage.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes, switching between GLP-1 medications is possible and sometimes done for various reasons (side effects, insurance coverage, better efficacy). Your doctor will determine the appropriate starting dose on the new medication based on what dose you were taking previously. You typically don't need to re-titrate from the lowest dose.</p>
