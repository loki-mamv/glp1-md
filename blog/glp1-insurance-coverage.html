<h1>GLP-1 Insurance Coverage: A Practical Guide to Getting Your Medication Paid For</h1>
<div class="article-meta">Updated February 2026 · 9 min read</div>

<p>The clinical data on GLP-1 medications is impressive. The insurance landscape is not. For many patients, the most significant barrier to starting Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, or Zepbound is not a medical question but a financial one. At list prices of $900 to $1,400 per month, these medications are unaffordable for most people without insurance coverage or manufacturer assistance.</p>

<p>This guide walks through the current state of coverage as of early 2026, including what is typically covered, what is not, and the practical steps you can take to reduce your costs.</p>

<h2>The Coverage Landscape: Diabetes vs. Weight Loss</h2>

<p>The single most important factor determining whether your insurance will cover a GLP-1 medication is the indication — the reason your doctor is prescribing it. Coverage for type 2 diabetes is broadly available. Coverage for weight loss is not.</p>

<h3>For Type 2 Diabetes (Ozempic, Mounjaro, Trulicity, etc.)</h3>

<p>Most commercial insurance plans and Medicare Part D include at least one GLP-1 agonist on their formulary for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. However, coverage is not automatic. Nearly all plans require prior authorization, which means your doctor must submit documentation demonstrating that the medication is medically appropriate for you. Common requirements include:</p>

<ul>
<li>A confirmed diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (A1C lab results)</li>
<li>Documentation that you have tried and failed metformin (or have a contraindication to it)</li>
<li>In some cases, documentation that you have tried a sulfonylurea or SGLT2 inhibitor</li>
</ul>

<p>Once approved, copays vary widely depending on your plan's formulary tier. GLP-1 medications are typically placed on a specialty or non-preferred brand tier, which means higher out-of-pocket costs than generic medications. Expect copays in the range of $25 to $300 per month after prior authorization approval, depending on your specific plan.</p>

<h3>For Weight Loss (Wegovy, Zepbound, Saxenda)</h3>

<p>Coverage for obesity medications is substantially more limited, and this remains one of the most contentious areas of health insurance policy in the United States.</p>

<p>According to a 2024 analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation, approximately 40 percent of large employer health plans now cover at least one anti-obesity medication. This represents significant growth from roughly 25 percent in 2022, driven in part by the strong clinical trial data from the STEP and SURMOUNT programs. But that still means most plans either explicitly exclude weight loss medications or have restrictive coverage criteria.</p>

<p>Plans that do cover Wegovy or Zepbound for weight loss generally require:</p>

<ul>
<li>BMI documentation (usually from two or more office visits)</li>
<li>BMI of 30 or greater, or BMI of 27 or greater with at least one weight-related comorbidity</li>
<li>Evidence of a structured weight management program (diet, exercise, counseling)</li>
<li>Prior authorization, sometimes requiring step therapy through older, cheaper medications first</li>
</ul>

<h2>Medicare and Medicaid</h2>

<h3>Medicare Part D</h3>

<p>Medicare Part D covers GLP-1 medications for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The Inflation Reduction Act, which took full effect in 2025, capped annual out-of-pocket spending on Part D medications at $2,000 — a significant benefit for patients on expensive GLP-1 therapies who previously might have fallen into the coverage gap ("donut hole").</p>

<p>However, Medicare Part D has historically excluded coverage for medications prescribed solely for weight loss. The Treat and Reduce Obesity Act, which would have required Medicare to cover FDA-approved anti-obesity medications, was introduced in Congress multiple times but as of early 2026 has not been passed into law. There is growing bipartisan support, particularly given the cardiovascular data from the SELECT trial, but it remains legislatively uncertain.</p>

<p>A practical workaround that some physicians use: if a Medicare patient has both type 2 diabetes and obesity, prescribing Ozempic or Mounjaro for the diabetes indication (which is covered) provides weight loss as a secondary benefit. This is a legitimate clinical decision — both medications are FDA-approved for diabetes — but it does not provide access to the higher doses available in Wegovy or Zepbound.</p>

<h3>Medicaid</h3>

<p>Medicaid coverage varies by state. Most state Medicaid programs cover GLP-1 medications for diabetes with prior authorization, though formulary preferences differ. Coverage for obesity is more variable. Some states have added Wegovy or Zepbound to their preferred drug lists; many have not. Check your state's Medicaid formulary or contact your managed care organization directly.</p>

<h2>Manufacturer Savings Programs</h2>

<p>Both Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly operate savings programs that can dramatically reduce out-of-pocket costs for eligible patients. These programs are important enough that they are worth understanding in detail.</p>

<h3>Novo Nordisk Savings Programs (Ozempic, Wegovy)</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ozempic Savings Card:</strong> Commercially insured patients may pay as little as $25 per 1-, 2-, or 3-month prescription. Maximum savings of $150 per fill for up to 24 months. Not available for patients on government insurance (Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE).</li>
<li><strong>Wegovy Savings Card:</strong> Similar terms — up to $225 off per 28-day supply for commercially insured patients. Maximum savings of $500 per fill.</li>
<li><strong>Novo Nordisk Patient Assistance Program (PAP):</strong> For uninsured patients who meet income eligibility requirements (generally household income at or below 400 percent of the federal poverty level), the medication may be provided at no cost.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Eli Lilly Savings Programs (Mounjaro, Zepbound)</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Mounjaro Savings Card:</strong> Commercially insured patients may pay as little as $25 per month. Not available for government-insured patients.</li>
<li><strong>Zepbound Savings Card:</strong> Similar terms for the weight loss indication.</li>
<li><strong>LillyDirect:</strong> Eli Lilly launched a direct-to-consumer platform where patients can purchase Zepbound starting at $399 per month for single-dose vials, without going through insurance. This was introduced specifically to address the coverage gap for weight loss patients and has been one of the more notable developments in GLP-1 access.</li>
<li><strong>Lilly Cares:</strong> Patient assistance program for eligible uninsured patients.</li>
</ul>

<div class="info-box">
<h3>Important Note on Savings Cards</h3>
<p>Manufacturer savings cards cannot be used with government insurance programs (Medicare, Medicaid, VA, TRICARE). They are restricted to patients with commercial or private insurance. Patients on Medicare who need assistance should look into patient assistance programs (PAPs) or state pharmaceutical assistance programs instead.</p>
</div>

<h2>What to Do If You Are Denied</h2>

<p>Insurance denials for GLP-1 medications are common, especially for weight loss indications. A denial is not necessarily the final answer. Here is a practical approach to appealing:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Understand the reason for denial.</strong> The explanation of benefits (EOB) or denial letter will specify the reason — formulary exclusion, insufficient documentation, step therapy requirement, or other criteria. Each requires a different response.</li>
<li><strong>Ask your doctor to submit a peer-to-peer review.</strong> Many denials can be overturned when your prescribing physician speaks directly with the insurance company's medical reviewer. This is often the fastest path to approval.</li>
<li><strong>Provide additional documentation.</strong> If the denial is based on insufficient evidence of medical necessity, have your doctor submit a detailed letter of medical necessity including your weight history, comorbidities, previous weight loss attempts, and relevant clinical trial data supporting the medication's use in your situation.</li>
<li><strong>File a formal appeal.</strong> Insurance companies are required by law to have an appeals process. First-level appeals are reviewed internally; if denied again, you can request an external review by an independent third party. External reviews overturn insurance denials approximately 40 to 60 percent of the time, according to data from state insurance departments.</li>
<li><strong>Contact your state insurance commissioner.</strong> If you believe your plan is not complying with its coverage terms or applicable state law, your state insurance department can investigate.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Compounded Semaglutide: A Cheaper Alternative?</h2>

<p>Since semaglutide shortages began in 2022, compounding pharmacies have been legally permitted to produce compounded versions of the drug under FDA enforcement discretion during the shortage period. These compounded versions are substantially cheaper — often $200 to $400 per month compared to $900+ for the brand-name product.</p>

<div class="warning-box">
<h3>FDA Warnings on Compounded GLP-1 Medications</h3>
<p>The FDA has issued multiple safety communications regarding compounded semaglutide and tirzepatide. Compounded drugs are not FDA-approved, do not undergo the same manufacturing quality controls, and have been associated with adverse events including dosing errors, contamination, and the use of semaglutide salt forms (such as semaglutide sodium) that are not bioequivalent to the approved product. If you choose a compounded version, use a 503B outsourcing facility that is registered with the FDA and subject to current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) inspections.</p>
</div>

<p>The legal status of compounded semaglutide is evolving. Once the FDA determines that the shortage has resolved, the enforcement discretion that permits compounding may be withdrawn, which would significantly limit availability. This has been the subject of litigation between compounding pharmacies and the FDA, and the situation remains fluid as of early 2026.</p>

<h2>The Cost Trajectory: Where Things Are Heading</h2>

<p>Several factors suggest that GLP-1 medication access will improve over the coming years, though the timeline is uncertain:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Employer coverage expansion.</strong> Major employers including Walmart, JPMorgan, and numerous Fortune 500 companies have added GLP-1 coverage for weight loss, citing data showing reduced long-term healthcare costs.</li>
<li><strong>State mandates.</strong> Several states are considering legislation requiring insurance coverage of FDA-approved anti-obesity medications, similar to existing mandates for diabetes supplies.</li>
<li><strong>Medicare expansion.</strong> The political pressure to cover anti-obesity medications under Medicare continues to build, driven by the SELECT cardiovascular outcomes data.</li>
<li><strong>Patent expirations.</strong> Semaglutide's composition of matter patent in the US is expected to expire in 2031-2032. Generic versions (biosimilars) would dramatically reduce costs, though the timeline for biosimilar GLP-1 products remains uncertain.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the meantime, the practical path for most patients involves working with their prescriber to navigate prior authorization, utilizing manufacturer savings programs, and being prepared to appeal denials. It is not a smooth process, but for many patients, the effort is worthwhile.</p>
